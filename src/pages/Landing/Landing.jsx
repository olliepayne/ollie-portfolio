      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Oliver, or Ollie, and I'm a Fullstack Developer and Competitive Sport Climber!
        <br />
        Through spending the last two years in the fitness industry, I learned how to achieve goals in the quickest, simplest, and most efficient manner.
        <br />
        My personal ethos is to be confident, yet humble and respectful of all who are around me. 
        <br />
        Iâ€™m constantly making an effort to grow mentally and physically, which both allow me to efficiently develop my technical skills.
