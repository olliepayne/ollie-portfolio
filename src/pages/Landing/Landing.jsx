      <p>
        I'm a Fullstack Engineer and Competitive Sport Climber. 
        Through spending the last two years in the fitness industry, I learned how to achieve goals in the quickest, simplest, and most efficient manner. 
        My personal ethos is to be confident, yet humble and respectful of all who are around me. 
        Iâ€™m constantly making an effort to grow mentally and physically, which both allow me to efficiently develop my technical skills.
